# Comparative Study Of Neural Networks
 Automated facial expression recognition systems have many applications. With the success of deep learning techniques FER systems are getting better. This project presents a comprehensive survey on deep facial expression recognition systems . A comparative study is carried out using various convolutional neural networks and support vector machine models. It is shown that combining the power of CNN and SVM gives a better performance.
